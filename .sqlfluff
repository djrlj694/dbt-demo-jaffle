# Rule definitions:
# AL01 / L011: Implicit/explicit aliasing of table (use 'as' for alias)
# AL02 / L012: Implicit/explicit aliasing of columns (use 'as' for alias)
# AL03 / L013: Column expression without alias (use 'as' for alias)
# AL07 / L031: Avoid table aliases in from clauses and join conditions
# AM02 / L033: UNION [DISTINCT|ALL] is preferred over just UNION
# AM05 / L051: Join clauses should be fully qualified (LEFT/RIGHT/FULL/INNER)
# AM06 / L054: Use numbers in GROUP BY and ORDER BY
# CP01 / L010: Inconsistent capitalisation of keywords (should be lowercase)
# CP02 / L014: Inconsistent capitalisation of unquoted identifiers (should be lowercase)
# CP03 / L030: Inconsistent capitalisation of function names (should be lowercase)
# CP04 / L040: Inconsistent capitalisation of boolean/null literal (should be lowercase)
# JJ01 / L046: Jinja tags should have a single whitespace on either side.
# LT01 / L023: Single whitespace expected after AS in WITH clause.
# LT01 / L048: Quoted literals should be surrounded by a single whitespace.
# LT02 / L002: Mixed Tabs and Spaces in single whitespace
# LT02 / L004: Incorrect indentation type (should be space)
# LT02 / L004: Commas should not have whitespace directly before them.
# LT04 / L019: Trailing comma enforcement
# LT05 / L016: Line is too long
# LT07 / L018: WITH clause closing bracket should be on a new line.
# LT08 / L022: Blank line expected but not found after CTE closing bracket.
# LT11 / L065: Set operators should be surrounded by newlines.
# RF02 / L027: References should be qualified if select has more than one referenced table/view
# ST07 / L032: Prefer specifying join keys instead of using USING.
# ST06 / L034: Select wildcards then simple targets before calculations and aggregates
# ST05 / L042: Join/From clauses should not contain subqueries. Use CTEs instead.
